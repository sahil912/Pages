                    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
                    <p>GigLedger is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your financial data belongs to you and you alone. This privacy policy explains how we handle (or more accurately, don't handle) your data.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <strong>The Short Version:</strong> We don't collect any of your data. Everything stays on your device.
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
                    <p><strong>None.</strong></p>
                    <p>GigLedger does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. All your financial data—including income records, expense entries, and tax calculations—is stored locally on your device.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
                    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
                    <p>All data you enter into GigLedger is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's secure storage systems. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Income entries and transaction history</li>
                        <li>Expense records and categories</li>
                        <li>Custom income sources you create</li>
                        <li>App settings and preferences</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h3>
                    <p>If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account. This allows you to access your data across multiple Apple devices. Important points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>iCloud sync is <strong>optional</strong> and disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Your data is encrypted end-to-end by Apple</li>
                        <li>We have <strong>no access</strong> to your iCloud data</li>
                        <li>Your data is governed by Apple's iCloud privacy policy</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data We Don't Collect</h2>
                    <p>To be completely clear, GigLedger does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collect personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                        <li>Track your location</li>
                        <li>Access your contacts or photos</li>

                        <li>Share data with third parties</li>
                        <li>Use analytics or crash reporting services</li>
                        <li>Require account creation or login</li>
                        <li>Store any data on our servers (we don't have servers)</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>GigLedger does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app operates entirely offline (except for optional iCloud sync with Apple's services).</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Export</h2>
                    <p>You can export your data at any time using the CSV export feature. This creates a file stored locally on your device that you can share however you choose (with your accountant, tax software, etc.). We are never involved in this process.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
                    <p>Since all data is stored on your device, you have complete control over it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delete individual entries within the app</li>
                        <li>Delete all app data through the app's settings</li>
                        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all data from your device</li>
                        <li>If using iCloud sync, manage your data through iCloud settings</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>GigLedger is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we don't collect any data from any users, this includes children.</p>

                    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. Since we don't collect your contact information, we cannot notify you directly—please check this page periodically.</p>
