                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I set up my shop profile?</h3>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I update daily gold rates?</h3>
                    <p>On the Dashboard (Home tab), tap "Update Rates" or the rate card. Enter the 24K rate, and rates for other purities (22K, 18K, 14K) will be calculated automatically. You can also manually adjust individual purity rates.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the Exchange Calculator?</h3>
                    <p>The Exchange Calculator handles transactions where a customer brings old gold and takes new jewelry. It calculates the old gold value, new jewelry price, and shows the balance amount to pay or return - all in one screen.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <p>Presets save your standard making charges for different jewelry types. Go to Settings > Making Charge Presets to create presets for rings, chains, bangles, etc. When calculating, simply select a preset to auto-fill the making charges.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <h3>How is old gold wastage calculated?</h3>
                    <p>Wastage is deducted as a percentage from the gross value of old gold. For example, with 0.5% wastage on Rs.10,000 gross value, the wastage deduction would be Rs.50, giving a net value of Rs.9,950.</p>
                </div>
