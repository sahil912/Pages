                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>GigLedger uses official IRS tax rates for 2024-2025 to calculate your estimated self-employment tax (15.3%) and federal income tax. However, these are <strong>estimates only</strong>. Your actual tax liability may vary based on deductions, credits, state taxes, and other income. We recommend consulting a tax professional for personalized advice.</p>

                            <p>Yes! When adding income, scroll to the bottom of the source list and tap "Add Custom Source." You can create sources for any type of gig work, freelance income, or side hustle.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Export Data</strong>. You can export your income and expense history as a CSV file, which works with Excel, Google Sheets, and most tax software. The file is saved to your device and you choose where to share it.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>By default, your data is stored only on your device. To back up across devices, enable <strong>iCloud Sync</strong> in Settings. Your data will be encrypted and synced through your personal iCloud account. We recommend also using the CSV export feature for additional backups.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>You can delete individual entries by swiping left on them in the History tab. To delete all data, go to <strong>Settings → Delete All Data</strong>. Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the app also removes all data from your device.</p>

                            <p><strong>No.</strong> We don't collect your data, so we can't sell it.
